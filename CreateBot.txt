After creating our desired Lambda Funcitons we now have to create a bot through AWS that we can train using our funciton.
So going through 

In AWS in the LEX console, I chose create and applied the following configs


    Bot name: PizzaOrderingBot

    Language: Choose the language and locale for your bot.

    Output voice: Salli

    Session timeout : 5 minutes.

    COPPA: Choose the appropriate response.

    User utterance storage: Choose the appropriate response.


I now had to create intent, which I named OrderPizza

After creating intent I created Slot Types with the following configs


    Slot type name – Crusts

    Description – Available crusts

    Choose Restrict to Slot values and Synonyms

    Value – Thick

    Synonyms - stuffed

Added slot to intent

Changed the name of the slot from slotOne to crust. Change the prompt to What kind of crust would you like?

Repeated previous steps for the following configurations

    Name - Sizes  ,  PizzaKinda

    Description - Available sizes  ,  Available Pizzas

    Values - Small, Medium, Large  ,  veg, cheese

    Slot name - size  ,  pizzaKind

    Prompt - What size Pizza?  ,  Do you want a veg or cheese pizza?

I then configured the Intent of OrderPizza to fullfill a user's request to order a pizza. Added the following strings as sample Utterances


    I want to order pizza please

    I want to order a pizza

    I want to order a {pizzaKind} pizza

    I want to order a {size} {pizzaKind} pizza

    I want a {size} {crust} crust {pizzaKind} pizza

    Can I get a pizza please

    Can I get a {pizzaKind} pizza

    Can I get a {size} {pizzaKind} pizza

Lambda initialization and validation – left as default.

Confirmation prompt – left as default.

Fulfillment: In the fulfillment tab I told the bot to choose the Lambda funciton (PizzaOrderProcessor) as for what it has to fulfill
Did some final configurations to the bot
